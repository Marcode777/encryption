// Create a new DB
// Create an express / handlebars / node.js / mysql app
// Make a page that will allow users create a user name and password
// Make a page that will allow users to login
// Valiate the name so it's only strings, and password that it has at least 8 characters
// Setup the model and save password into the database as hash
// Check the password against the hash before login
